  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Component is a tiny, no-dependency library designed for top-down applications.</p>
<p> It&#39;s essential a factory, that provides two things on it&#39;s factories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decorators through <code>addDecorator</code></li>
<li>Dependency Injection through <code>addStatics</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Works great with React. Because React apps use gradual controller-view -&gt; view trees
DI is typically very simple and more akin to global variables. Decorators are helpful
for medium to large scale apps. They can help you have default mixins, and automate
other tasks you&#39;d normally do all over the place.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var c1 = Component();

c1.addDecorator(spec =&gt; {
  spec.decorated = true;
  return spec;
});

c1.addStatics(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;);

assert(c1.hello === &#39;world&#39;);
assert(c1({}) === { decorated: true })
</code></pre>

<h2 id="re-app-hacker-news-app">re.app Hacker News App</h2>
<p>This is a demo app built on re.app, for reading HackerNews. It shows of a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flux + immutable data management with the data helpers</li>
<li>Nesting multiple different types of ViewLists</li>
<li>Theming</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reapp-kitchen-sink">reapp Kitchen Sink</h2>
<p>This is the kitchen sink demo app, showing off reapp-ui and built
with a few components from reapp.</p>

<p>Injects <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign">Object.assign</a>
into your apps.</p>
<p>Polyfill taken from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign">MDN</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reapp-pack">reapp-pack</h2>
<p>A helper for generating webpack configs, along with some small helpers.
Includes <code>./webpackServer</code> for easy use of webpack-dev-server.</p>
<p>Based heavily on the official <a href="https://github.com/webpack/react-starter">webpack/react-starter</a> repo.</p>
<p>Webpack is just an export of the version of webpack used in this repository.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>See required files in <code>./config</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var config = require(&#39;./config/webpack.run.js&#39;);
var webpackServer = require(&#39;reapp-pack/webpackServer&#39;);

webpackServer(config, {
  port: 3011,
  debug: true,
  hot: true
});
</code></pre>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>See <code>./index.js</code>.</p>
<h3 id="mit-license">MIT License</h3>

<h3 id="reapp-platform">reapp platform</h3>
<p>This repo is to help simplify package.json with reapp apps.</p>
<p>Compiles all the smaller reapp modules together, and provides helper functions.</p>
<p>See the package.json for each individual sub-module, and ./src for helper functions.</p>

<p>Simple reducer for use with flux. Reduces an array or map into an array of objects with:
  { id, data, status }</p>
<p>Status is given first so we can allow currying, ex:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var loadedReducer = reducer.bind(null, &#39;LOADED&#39;);

fetch(url).then(loadedReducer).then(store);
</code></pre>
<p>status is optional, default value is &#39;OK&#39;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">assert(reducer([1]) === [{ id: 0, data: 1, status: &#39;OK&#39; }]
</code></pre>

<p>A small library for generating a tree of objects representing routes,
as well as file paths.</p>
<p>See the index.js for more in-code documentation.</p>
<p>Can be used to reduce a lot of require boilerplate when you create
and app with a consistent route -&gt; directory mapping. Provides some options
for times when the structure isn&#39;t so well mapped :).</p>
<p>Needs something like Webpack that can handle dynamic requires.</p>
<h3 id="todo">Todo</h3>
<ul>
<li>Document it a bit better</li>
<li>Add tests</li>
<li>Possibly remove <code>routes</code> just use <code>route</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Using react-router helpers:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">var { route, routes } = require(&#39;reapp-routes/react-router/generator&#39;);

module.exports = routes(require,
  route(&#39;app&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, { dir: &#39;&#39; },
    route(&#39;kitchen&#39;, &#39;/&#39;,
      route(&#39;controls&#39;),
      route(&#39;modals&#39;),
      route(&#39;popovers&#39;),
      route(&#39;forms&#39;)
    ),
    route(&#39;viewer&#39;)
  )
);
</code></pre>
<p>Rolling your own:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">var React = require(&#39;react&#39;);
var { Route, DefaultRoute } = require(&#39;react-router&#39;);
var { route, routes } = require(&#39;react-router-generator&#39;);

module.exports = generate(routes(
  { dir: &#39;components/&#39; },
  route({ name: &#39;app&#39;, path: &#39;/&#39;, dir: &#39;&#39; },
    route(&#39;kitchen&#39;,
      route(&#39;controls&#39;),
      route(&#39;modals&#39;),
      route(&#39;popovers&#39;)
    )
  )
));

function generate(props) {
  props.children = props.children ? props.children.map(generate) : null;
  props.handler = require(props.handlerPath);

  return props.defaultRoute ?
    &lt;DefaultRoute {...props} /&gt; :
    &lt;Route {...props} /&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Corresponing file tree, notice how <code>dir</code> affects nesting:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-text">/components
  /kitchen
    Controls.jsx
    Modals.jsx
    Popovers.jsx
  Kitchen.jsx
  App.jsx
</code></pre>

<h3 id="reapp-server">reapp-server</h3>
<p>reapp-server provides express and webpack servers that work together to serve
a reapp app.</p>
<p>reapp-server takes in options that it uses to build the webpack config. By default
it runs in development mode and looks for a /config/config.development.js file to
determine options. It includes default configs for development and production though.</p>
<p>See <code>./webpack/config.*.js</code> for the default config files.</p>
<p>See <code>./webpack/make.js</code> for how to builds the webpack config.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<pre><code>mode: corresponds to config files, typically &#39;development&#39; or &#39;production&#39;
port: port to serve on, webpack server port by default is +1 of this
wport: optional, to specify custom webpack server work
staticPaths: array of strings, relative paths of where to serve static assets
dir: dir of where to serve app
debug: turn on debugging from webpack
hostname: set hostname to serve from, default &#39;localhost&#39;
</code></pre><h3 id="todo">TODO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Figure out better if its in a reapp directory before symlinking server_modules</li>
<li>Lots of work needed to get production apps running again</li>
<li>Also work to be done getting isomorphic working again</li>
<li>General organization and code docs throughout</li>
<li>Vendor splitting isn&#39;t integrated into ./webpack/server.js</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="welcome-to-reapp">Welcome to reapp</h2>
<p>Reapp is a web application framework that includes
everything needed to create cross-platform applications.</p>
<p>Reapp is built on React, npm, and JavaScript, and it&#39;s
beneficial to get to know the three of them before you
will be productive in reapp.</p>
<p>...</p>

<h2 id="reapp-ui">reapp-ui</h2>
<p><em>This is an alpha release: seeking feedback, expect missing pieces, laughable mistakes, big changes</em></p>
<p>reapp-ui is a set of React components for building app UI&#39;s. It has a few goals</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow pick-and-choose usage</li>
<li>Work well together</li>
<li>Lightweight code with few dependencies</li>
<li>Themeable</li>
<li>Adaptable to many platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Near-term goals are to finish out all the components in the toolkit,
get and implement feedback from the community, fix any glaring performance
and visual issues, and then create an Android theme.</p>
<p>It includes quite a few things that may end up in their own repo&#39;s, once the code
has settled out a bit into something more coherent.</p>
<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aim for performance and consistency.</li>
<li>Keep the repo structure as flat as possible.</li>
<li>Decouple components. Allow selective usage of these components.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="todo">Todo</h3>
<p>See TODO.md for more high level stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>More fully implement constants use in styles, make more consistant</li>
<li><p>Move iOS theme to it&#39;s own repo, make Android theme</p>
</li>
<li><p>Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alerts</li>
<li>Form elments: Slider</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Popover that slides up from bottom</li>
<li>Photo viewer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Actions</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Pull-to-refresh</li>
<li>Slideable &amp; Sortable ListItem actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<pre><code>  /actions
    Internal: for components to communicate
  /assets
    Icons, etc
  /behaviors
    (!) Used within components, can be passed in to override
  /components
    The UI components
  /helpers
    Components which don&#39;t map directly to user-viewable, helper components
  /lib
    Internally used functions
  /mixins
    All mixins (used internally and externally)
  /stores
    Internal: should be removable once parent-based contexts are implemented in React
  /themes
    Theme files users can require
</code></pre><h4 id="index-js">index.js</h4>
<p>Used to set up reapp-ui.</p>
<p>reapp-ui uses three different things that must be imported at init. These
things are imported so they can be mixed and matched for use with adapating
theme or behavior.</p>
<p>For now it has three relevant methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>addConstants</code>: constants allow users to customize themes easily. They are used
in styles (and in the future could be used with animations and more).
<strong>See /themes/ios/constants/* for examples.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>addStyles</code>: styles objects, keys map to the names of components and values are
objects that are CSS styles in JS. Values can optionally be a function, that takes
in the constants as the argument.
<strong>See /themes/ios/styles/* for examples.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>addAnimations</code>: animations are objects, keys are names, values are functions that
take an object with <code>index</code>, <code>step</code> as keys, an optionally extra keys with more info.
<strong>See /themes/ios/animations.js for examples.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To see how you&#39;d make a theme, I&#39;d suggest looking at <code>/themes/ios/theme.js</code>. You
can require that file to have the entire iOS theme setup for you automatically.</p>
<h4 id="component-js">component.js</h4>
<p>component is a decorator that is used internally by reapp-ui to make components. It
was extracted out and is a nice set of mixins that allow the ui components to avoid
reptitious code.</p>
<p>This is an important file to look at before understanding how this library works,
and from there, the Mixins that are used here make the foundation of the UI kit.</p>

<p><em>reapp is just launching in alpha. These docs are far from complete and subject to change!</em></p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Installation is done through npm, though you can pick and choose any pieces you&#39;d like
and roll your own stack. To get the reapp CLI:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g reapp
</code></pre><p>Once that&#39;s done you can generate a new base reapp stack with:</p>
<pre><code>reapp new [name]
</code></pre><p>Where [name] is the name you&#39;d like to give your new stack.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-this-give-you-">What does this give you?</h4>
<p>reapp new is actually a simple wrapper that clones a bare repository that we&#39;ve set up
to use the various reapp pieces optimally. We are working on having a few different
setups, from simple to advanced, that you can choose from when generating your app.</p>
<h3 id="cli">CLI</h3>
<p>The CLI has two main functions that it helps you with. The first is creating new apps.
For now, it simple makes a bare clone of a repo we keep updated with the current best-practice.
The goal is eventually to have a variety of baseline repo&#39;s to choose from.</p>
<p>It also lets you run your app, using <a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-server">reapp-server</a>,
a simple express server that works well with the default app structure.</p>
<p>CLI Usage:</p>
<pre><code>Usage: reapp [options] [command]

Commands:

  new [name]  creates a directory with a new reapp-starter scaffold
  run         runs a reapp application with express/webpack-dev-server
  build       builds a reapp application to a bundle in ./build
  help [cmd]  display help for [cmd]

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
</code></pre><h3 id="app-structure">App Structure</h3>
<p>You can see the exact app that&#39;s generated through the <a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-starter">reapp-starter repo</a>.
It&#39;s very simple for now:</p>
<pre><code>/app
  /components
  /theme
  app.js
  routes.js
/assets
  layout.html
/config (optional)
</code></pre><p><code>./app/app.js</code> is your entry point. Everything in the app folder should be pretty
self-explanatory. <code>./assets</code> contains static assets, with a <code>layout.html</code> that is used
to serve your app within. In general, you should&#39;t have to touch the layout, even for
adding styles.</p>
<p>If you place a build.webpack.js or run.webpack.js in your config folder, the reapp CLI
will use these configs instead of the pre-made ones. To see more on the default configs,
check out the files in the <code>./config</code> folder of the
<a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-pack">reapp-pack repo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="included-modules">Included modules</h3>
<p>If you&#39;d like to explore more deeply into how various pieces of reapp work together,
you&#39;ll want to check the documentation on the included modules. Here
they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-ui">reapp-ui</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-routes">reapp-routes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-platform">reapp-platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-component">reapp-component</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-request">reapp-request</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>Our initial goals are simple: focus on completeness, consistency, and performance.
Also, a theme for Android.</p>
<p>Down the road we&#39;d like to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isomorphic</strong> - Render first on server, pass data over
to client to continue from there (easily achievable).</li>
<li><strong>Responsive</strong> - Support for tablet style interfaces
and JS-powered responsive styling.</li>
<li><strong>Physics</strong> - A spring based physics library
into the animation library with an easy syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Interaction</strong> - A simple, declarative interaction
library that can be composed well with reapp</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development-environment">Development Environment</h3>
<p>Sublime users, some helpful plugins for you to install:</p>
<ul>
<li>SublimeLinter</li>
<li>eshint</li>
<li>JavaScript Next - ES6 Syntax</li>
