            reapp is just launching in alpha. These docs are far from complete and subject to change!
          </em>

          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <p>
            Installation is done through npm, though you can pick and choose any pieces you'd like
            and roll your own stack. To get the reapp CLI:
          </p>

          <code>
            npm install -g reapp
          </code>

          <p>
            Once that's done you can generate a new base reapp stack with:
          </p>

          <code>
            reapp new [name]
          </code>

          <p>
            Where [name] is the name you'd like to give your new stack.
          </p>

          <h4>What does this give you?</h4>
          <p>
            reapp new is actually a simple wrapper that clones a bare repository that we've set up
            to use the various reapp pieces optimally.
          </p>

          <h3>CLI</h3>
          <p>
            The CLI has two main functions that it helps you with. The first is creating new apps.
            For now, it simple makes a bare clone of a repo we keep updated with the current best-practice.
            The goal is eventually to have a variety of baseline repo's to choose from.
          </p>

          <p>
            It also lets you run your app, using <a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-server">reapp-server</a>.
            reapp-server is a simple express server and webpack server that are designed to give you a modern JS stack.

          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <p>
            Our initial goals are simple: focus on completeness and performance.
            Followed by a complete theme for Android.
          </p>

          <p>
            Down the road we'd like to achieve the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Isomorphic</strong> - Render first on server, pass data over
              to client to continue from there (easily achievable).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Responsive</strong> - Support for tablet style interfaces
              and JS-powered responsive styling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Physics</strong> - A spring based physics library
              into the animation library with an easy syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interaction</strong> - A simple, declarative interaction
              library that can be composed well with reapp
            </li>
          </ul>
